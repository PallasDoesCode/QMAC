This project was developed using C# and Windows Presentation Foundation. It was my first WPF application and my first time using the MVVM design pattern. It gives you the ability to quickly get MAC addresses for all wired and wireless network adapters.

I created this project for the IT Department at the DeKalb County Board of Education. They were instituting a new DHCP white list and needed a quick way to get the MAC address for each computer during the set up process. This project was the solution used to resolve that need.
